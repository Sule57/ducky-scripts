# ducky-scripts
A collection of actually working rubber ducky scripts that I found/created.

This repository is created just so I make sure that I don't lose the actually working scripts for a rubber ducky/badusb that I either found or created. 

You are welcome to use the scripts from this repository for **EDUCATIONAL** and **TESTING PURPOSES**.

The creator and/or contributors are not responsible for any misuse of the repository content.
